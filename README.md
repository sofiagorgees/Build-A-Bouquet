- A summary of your program, including a list of Module 2 concepts used
  - For our project we wanted to create a bouquet of tulips. For the concept used in Module 2 we did:
    - Inheritance class relationship
        - "A tulip is a flower"
     - Component class relationship
       - "A bouquet has a flower"
       - "A flower has petals, colors, shapes, and height"
    - File input and/or output
      - We made a csv file that contains the "inventory" of our flower store. If the user wants to buy a flower from our store the, the program reads into the file to then display the contents of the file to the user.
There is also a file bouquet.csv that records all the flowers the user chose in csv format.
- Any known bugs at time of submission
  - When running the program on a new computer the programmer has to delete the cmakecache.txt and reran the program, then everything should work as intended 
- Future work (how you could expand the program with more time)
    - For the graphics module, we could create an actual bouquet graphic with the correct color, petal shape, and height of each tulip
- The grade you think you have earned, based on the grading rubric below, with justification
    - I think we have earned 50 points. We lost some since we didn't create the repo with one week to work on it. However, we have used all of the module 2 concepts, we have a video, and created a testing program.
