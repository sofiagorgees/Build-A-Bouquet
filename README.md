## Summary

* This is a build-a-bouquet program that utilizes inheritance, component relationships, and CSV file input and output.
* The program prompts the user to build a bouquet and gathers information regarding how many flowers they would like, if they want to pick from the garden or store, and at the end if they would like to build another bouquet. At the end a CSV file is created that has all the flowers the user chose.

## Languages Used
* The program solely utilizes C++ in input/output and working with files.

## Other
* This program was a group project that me and Tara Bayliss worked on.
